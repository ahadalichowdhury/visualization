# ✨ REACT FLOW CONTROLS REMOVED

## 🧹 What's Gone
- **Zoom/Lock Buttons:** The default React Flow control panel (bottom-left buttons) has been completely removed.
- **Why:** You now rely on the modern Canvas Toolbar (Hand/Pointer) and standard mouse controls (Scroll to zoom, Drag to pan), keeping the UI cleaner.

## 🖼️ Current State
- **Attribution:** Hidden.
- **Controls:** Removed.
- **Info Panel:** Removed.
- **Result:** Pure canvas with your custom Toolbar at the top.

## 🛠️ Technical
- Removed `<Controls />` component usage and import from `Builder.tsx`.
- Rebuilt container.
